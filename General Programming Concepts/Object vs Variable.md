# Variable vs Objects
* Variables are created using primitive data types such as int or double _(stack)_
* Objects are also reference types variables and are created using class data types _(heap)_
* When creating an object the `new` operator allocates space in memory to store the object, and returns a reference to the objects memory location

> Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the language
