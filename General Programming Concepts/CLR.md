# CLR (Common Language Runtime)
Used for Csharp Dotnet 
## What & how tries to resolve?
Wants to provide flexibility to developers for multiplatforms. In the past, previous languages like C or C++ were compiled exclusive for Microsoft system, but in order to compete with Java, Microsoft develop C# to be able to run in any hardware, similar to Java, Microsoft created a way to ensure that C# will have an interpreter, in the case of Java is the Java Virtual Machine who receives a byte code language and then turns into machine code. C# does the same thing but with IL (Intermediate Language) -> CLR -> machine code.

## Other Concepts
* **JIT _(a.k.a. dynamic compilation)_ -** Just in Time -> used for interpreter languages in order to improve performance
* **AOT -** Ahead of Time compilation is the act of compile a language to an intermediate language
